# Weather Forecasting Using Python 🌤️

This project is a Python-based application for weather forecasting. It uses a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and provides forecasts for specific locations. The application is designed to be simple, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Features 📋
- Fetch current weather conditions for any location.
- View detailed weather forecasts (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- Supports multiple cities with dynamic location input.
- Clean and minimalistic code design.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Weather API**: Real-time weather data source.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `requests` for API calls.
  - `json` for handling API responses.
  - (Include additional libraries if used.)

## Setup and Installation ⚙️
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeMoN-7/Weather-Forecasting-Using-Python.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Weather-Forecasting-Using-Python
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Ensure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies.)

4. **Obtain an API Key**:
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) (or any other API provider).
   - Get your API key and add it to the code.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions 📖
1. Input the city name to get the current weather details.
2. View the output in a structured format (temperature, weather description, etc.).
3. Modify the code to add additional features or customize the output.
